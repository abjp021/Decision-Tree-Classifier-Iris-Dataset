# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
* Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems too.

* The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).

* In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the recordâ€™s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.
 

### Que. Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
### Aim:  The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
